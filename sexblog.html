        <h3>When Sex Hurts</h3>
        <p>When it comes to birth control, there are many options available, making it challenging to decide which one is right for you. In this blog post, we'll discuss the most common birth control options, their effectiveness, and what to consider when choosing the right one for you.</p>
        <p>The good news is that there are almost always solutions to painful or uncomfortable sex. The key is to be open and honest with your OB/GYN so we can identify the cause and offer you a new leash on life between the sheets. Some of the ways sex feels uncomfortable or painful include: <br>Pain during penetration (this may include using a tampon)
           <br>
            ● Pain during thrusting
            <br>
            ● Burning or aching pain
            <br>
            ● Pain or discomfort that lingers after you have sex.
            <br>

        <h2>
            Reasons Why Sex Is Painful</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the most common reasons sex is painful and potential solutions. But, again, a visit to your OB/GYN or midwife and a full disclosure conversation are essential to paving a more positive and pleasurable way forward.

        </p>

        <h3>1. You’ve experienced sexual trauma in the past</h3>
        <p>Women who were sexually abused, raped, or experienced sexual trauma can find sex extremely uncomfortable to downright painful. This is a psychological response rather than a physical one in most cases. However, even in the most comfortable and trusting environments and with a partner who makes you feel safe, the very act of being physically intimate or sexual can cause involuntary muscle contractions and “fight/flight/freeze” responses that reduce lubrication.</p>
        <h3>2. You have a latent infection</h3>
        <p>If you have pelvic inflammatory disease, urinary tract infections, STDs, or other latent issues like a yeast bacterial infection, it can irritate the vaginal tissues, including the labia and clitoris. Itching, burning, and feelings of rawness compound the issue. Getting cleared of potential infections or inflammation is a step in the right direction, and it prevents you from spreading something to your partner. Even yeast infections can pass back and forth, even though men tend to be more asymptomatic than women.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>3. Lack of lubrication</h3>
        <p>Every vagina is different and, while they are designed to be self-lubricating, some do a better job of that than others, and lubrication levels can ebb and flow throughout our lives. Lubrication is essential to pleasure, or hyper-friction causes discomfort. You may lack lubrication:
            <br>
            ● Lack of foreplay (get your partner on board for more foreplay, which results in more satisfying sex)
            <br>
            ● During certain times of the month, due to hormone fluctuations
            <br>
            ● As the result of a hormone imbalance
            <br>
            ● Due to perimenopause or menopause
            <br>
            ● You’ve just had a baby or are still breastfeeding
            <br>
            ● Medication side effects (any medications that cause dry mouth or affect mucous membranes can inhibit lubrication or negatively affect libido)
            <br>
            ● Stress, depression, lack of libido – all can diminish natural lubrication
            <br>
            If you feel your lubrication levels are lower than usual, see if any of those may be the cause. Over-the-counter products are there to help. Some of our patients’ favorite lubricants include:
            <br>
            ● Sliquid
            <br>
            ● Shine
            <br>
            ● Lelo Personal Moisturizer
            <br>
            ● Astroglide’s water-based lubricant</p>
        <br>
        <h3>4. Certain conditions or illnesses</h3>
        <p>Any condition or disease that affects your body can affect how you experience sex. That’s especially true if the conditions in question already affect the pelvis, abdomen, or reproductive organs. Besides the infections we’ve already covered in #2, some of the issues most likely to cause sexual discomfort or pain are:
            <br>
            ● Endometriosis
            <br>
            ● PCOS
            <br>
            ● Pelvic surgery or trauma
            <br>
            ● Cystitis  
            <br>
            ● Uterine fibroids
            <br>
            ● Autoimmune disorders that heighten inflammation
            <br>
            ● Irritable bowel syndrome</p>
        <br>
        <h3>5. Anatomical potentials</h3>
        <p>There is also a range of anatomical reasons for pain or discomfort during intercourse. For example:
            <br>
            ● Shorter or smaller vagina
            <br>
            ● Pelvic organ prolapse or a uterus that’s tilted forward or located lower than normal
            <br>
            ● Scarring
            <br>
            ● Muscle spasms that tighten the vaginal entry or canal (called vaginismus)
            <br>
            ● Skin disorders</p>
