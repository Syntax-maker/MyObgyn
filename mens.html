        <h3>Understanding Menstrual Irregularities</h3>
        <p>Menstrual irregularities refer to any changes in the regularity, frequency, or duration of menstrual periods. While it is common for some women to experience occasional irregular periods, persistent or severe changes in menstrual patterns may indicate an underlying medical condition that requires evaluation and treatment.</p>
        <p> A menstrual cycle that varies in length, duration, or flow can indicate an underlying health issue or hormonal imbalance. In this blog post, we'll discuss the types of menstrual irregularities, their causes, and when to see an OBGYN for evaluation and treatment.

            <br>

            <br>
